# üèóÔ∏è SPECTRA Repository Structure Standard (Pillar ‚Üí Domain ‚Üí Capability ‚Üí Service)

Purpose
Defines the mandatory repository structure, navigation metadata, and governance rules for every SPECTRA repository.

Scope
- Applies to all repositories under SPECTRADataSolutions
- Enforced by the reusable repo-structure-guard workflow in this repo
- British English and camelCase everywhere

Required README Navigation Header (top of README.md)
Use the nav block; values must be accurate.

<!-- NAV_START -->
**Dream**: SPECTRA  
**Pillar**: Guidance | Innovation | Engagement | Operations | Protection | Sustenance | Growth  
**Domain**: <singleTokenCamelCase>  
**Capability**: <singleTokenCamelCase>  
**Service**: <serviceName or owner/repo>
<!-- NAV_END -->

Repository Types and Folder Maps
All repos satisfy "Common", then add type-specific folders.
- Common: docs/, scripts/, tests/, meta/, .github/workflows/
- Engineering: stages/, utils/, principles/, conventions/, Tables/
- Operations: templates/, scripts/, docs/
- Applications: src/, components/, pages/ or app/, styles/
- Governance: roles/, contracts/, specs/, tools/
- Content: knowledge/, journal/, discussions/, templates/

Compliance and Enforcement
- Reusable workflow validates:
  - Presence/validity of nav header (Pillar, Domain, Capability, Service; Dream must be SPECTRA)
  - Required root files
  - British English cues
  - Baseline folders and .gitignore essentials
  - Type-specific folders (if repoType provided)

Adoption (per-repo)
```yaml
name: repoStructureGuard
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master, develop ]
jobs:
  validate:
    uses: SPECTRADataSolutions/.github/.github/workflows/repoStructureGuard.yml@main
    with:
      repoType: engineering
```

Notes
- "Service" can be a simple serviceName (camelCase) or owner/repo.
- Keep Dream in the header; it must be SPECTRA.
