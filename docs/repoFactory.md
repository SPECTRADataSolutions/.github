# ðŸ”„ Service Repository Generation (Migrated)

**This documentation has been superseded by the new Service Repository Generator.**

Please use the new documentation and workflows:

ðŸ“„ **[Service Repository Generation Documentation](./generateServiceRepository.md)**

ðŸ”§ **New Workflows:**
- `generateServiceRepository.yml` - Main service repository creation workflow
- `generateServiceRepositorySlash.yml` - Slash command trigger for repository creation
- `repoStructureGuard.yml` - Repository structure validation

## What Changed

The repository creation automation has been updated to follow SPECTRA's three-word, camelCase, verb-first naming conventions:

- `repoFactory.yml` â†’ `generateServiceRepository.yml`
- `repoFactorySlash.yml` â†’ `generateServiceRepositorySlash.yml`
- Updated to use British English throughout
- Enhanced Pillar â†’ Domain â†’ Capability â†’ Service metadata structure
- Improved compliance with SPECTRA standards

## Migration Note

All existing functionality remains the same, with improved naming and documentation. The slash command syntax is unchanged:

```
/repo create governancePolicy --pillar Protection --domain platformSecurity --capability threatDetection --type governance --visibility private
```
