# 🏭 (Deprecated) SPECTRA Repository Factory

This document has been superseded by [repositoryProvisioning.md](repositoryProvisioning.md).

The term "Repository Factory" has been replaced with the explicit term "Repository Provisioning" to improve clarity and align with self‑describing governance nomenclature.

## � Deprecation Notice

- New canonical workflow: `repository-provisioning`
- New documentation: `repositoryProvisioning.md`
- New secrets prefix: `SPECTRA_REPOSITORY_PROVISIONING_GITHUB_APP_*`
- Legacy secrets fallback removal target: 30 days from rename commit

After the deprecation window this file will be removed. Update any bookmarks or external references to the new path.

> 🏛️ Governance Principle: Terminology must be explicit; provisioning replaces factory to emphasise deterministic, policy‑driven creation instead of opaque generation.
