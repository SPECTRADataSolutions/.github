# outputs

Each initiative gets its own folder: `outputs/<initiativeId>/`

## standardFiles
- `summaryCard.md` — key facts (archetype, domain, capabilityAreas).
- `sprintPlan.md` — starter sprint plan skeleton to refine.
- `maturityTimeline.md` — milestones and risk spikes (text or image).
- `impactReport.md` — optional; results from decision simulations.

## notes
- Files are auto-created by workflows; edit safely as they are versioned.
- Keep additional artefacts inside the same initiative folder.
