# 🌌 SPECTRA Data Solutions

**AI-driven data engineering, orchestration, and automation in Microsoft Fabric.**

We are building the most structured, automated, and future-proof framework for data and AI.  
Every part of SPECTRA — from governance to community — is codified, automated, and aligned.

## 🏛️ The Four Pillars of SPECTRA
Our organisation is built on four orthogonal pillars. Each pillar has four domains,  
and every domain has focused capabilities and services.

- 🧭 [Doctrine](https://github.com/SPECTRADataSolutions/doctrine)  
  *Rules, intelligence, standards, and structure that define how SPECTRA operates.*  

- 🗣️ [Relations](https://github.com/SPECTRADataSolutions/relations)  
  *Branding, community, messaging, and marketing — how SPECTRA connects with people.*  

- 🔄 [Transformation](https://github.com/SPECTRADataSolutions/transformation)  
  *Architecture, research, design, and engineering that turn ideas into systems.*  

- ⚙️ [Operations](https://github.com/SPECTRADataSolutions/operations)  
  *Environment, Jira, automation, and delivery that keep everything running.*
