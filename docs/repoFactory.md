# üì¶ Repo Factory (Pillar ‚Üí Domain ‚Üí Capability ‚Üí Service)

Purpose
Create pillar/domain/capability/service repositories on demand with compliant navigation headers, labels, topics, a repository-structure guard workflow, and an intent manifest.

<details>
<summary>At a glance</summary>

- Triggers
  - Slash comment on an Initiative issue (recommended)
  - Manual workflow dispatch in Actions
- Inputs
  - repoName, pillar, domain, capability, repoType, visibility, desc, templateRepo (optional)
- Effects
  - Creates or updates a repository in the SPECTRADataSolutions organisation
  - Seeds README, .gitignore, labels, topics, meta/intent.yml
  - Applies repo-structure guard and basic branch protection
- Idempotent
  - Safe to retry; re-runs converge the repository to the requested state
</details>

## How to use

You can invoke Repo Factory in two ways. Both paths accept the same logical inputs.

### 1) Comment on an Initiative issue (recommended)

Post one of the supported slash commands as a top-level comment on a valid Initiative issue in this repository.

- Canonical form (key=value)
  ```
  /create-repo repoName=security pillar=Protection domain=platformSecurity capability=threatDetection repoType=governance visibility=private desc="Security governance and reusable checks" templateRepo=SPECTRADataSolutions/blueprint
  ```

- Legacy alias (positional, still supported)
  ```
  /repo create security --pillar Protection --domain platformSecurity --capability threatDetection --type governance --visibility private --desc "Security governance and reusable checks"
  ```

Notes:
- Use only kebab-case or camelCase for names; we enforce repository names in camelCase by default (e.g., securityGovernance).
- If omitted, templateRepo defaults to our standard blueprint.
- The bot will react to your comment with status emojis and post a result summary.

### 2) Run the workflow manually (Actions tab)

From the Actions tab, run ‚ÄúRepo Factory‚Äù and provide the same inputs. Typical values:

- repoName: securityGovernance
- pillar: Protection
- domain: platformSecurity
- capability: threatDetection
- repoType: governance
- visibility: private
- desc: Security governance and reusable checks
- templateRepo: SPECTRADataSolutions/blueprint (optional)

## What it does

When triggered, Repo Factory will:

- Create or update the target repository in the SPECTRADataSolutions organisation.
- Seed a README with the standard navigation header:
  - Dream ‚Üí Pillar ‚Üí Domain ‚Üí Capability ‚Üí Service
- Add a .gitignore suited to typical Fabric/analytics projects.
- Add and configure the repo-structure-guard reusable workflow (applied on pushes and PRs).
- Seed labels from .github/.github/labels.json (this repo).
- Set topics to include:
  - spectra, framework, pillar-<pillar>, domain-<domain>, capability-<capability>
- Add meta/intent.yml capturing P ‚Üí D ‚Üí C ‚Üí S:
  ```yaml
  # meta/intent.yml
  pillar: Protection
  domain: platformSecurity
  capability: threatDetection
  service: securityGovernance
  repoType: governance
  description: Security governance and reusable checks
  ```
- Apply best-effort protection on the default branch:
  - Require 1 approving review for PRs, dismiss stale approvals on new commits.

All operations are idempotent: re-running will reconcile files, labels, topics, and rules without duplication.

---

## Inputs

- repoName (string, required): The target repository name (camelCase preferred).
- pillar (string, required): Strategic pillar (e.g., Protection, Guidance, Acceleration).
- domain (string, required): Domain within the pillar (e.g., platformSecurity).
- capability (string, required): Capability within the domain (e.g., threatDetection).
- repoType (string, required): Type-specific checks (e.g., governance, service, blueprint).
- visibility (string, required): public or private.
- desc (string, required): Short repository description.
- templateRepo (string, optional): Template repository in owner/repo format; defaults to SPECTRADataSolutions/blueprint.

---

## Requirements

- Organisation secret ORG_ADMIN_TOKEN with scopes:
  - repo, admin:org
- This repository must contain:
  - The reusable repo-structure-guard workflow
  - Standard YAML and label seed at .github/.github/labels.json

---

## Outputs (what you will see)

- New or updated repository under SPECTRADataSolutions/{repoName}
- README seeded with navigation header and structure overview
- .gitignore present at repository root
- repo-structure-guard workflow configured
- Labels added/updated to match organisation catalogue
- Topics applied: spectra, framework, pillar-*, domain-*, capability-*
- meta/intent.yml created/updated with pillar/domain/capability/service

---

## Examples

- Governance repository (Protection ‚Üí platformSecurity ‚Üí threatDetection ‚Üí securityGovernance)
  ```
  /create-repo repoName=securityGovernance pillar=Protection domain=platformSecurity capability=threatDetection repoType=governance visibility=private desc="Security governance and reusable checks"
  ```

- Service repository starting from the blueprint (Star Wars training data)
  ```
  /create-repo repoName=tatooineIngestion pillar=Guidance domain=dataAcquisition capability=eventStreaming repoType=service visibility=private desc="Ingests Mos Eisley cantina telemetry" templateRepo=SPECTRADataSolutions/blueprint
  ```

---

## Troubleshooting

- Missing permission: Ensure ORG_ADMIN_TOKEN is configured as an organisation secret and available to this workflow.
- Name collisions: If a repository with the same name exists, Repo Factory will reconcile files and settings rather than failing.
- Invalid inputs: The bot will comment with a clear failure reason. Fix inputs and re-run.
- Branch protection API errors: Best-effort rules are applied; if the organisation policy blocks specific settings, the workflow will continue and report the deviation.

---

## Design notes

- Idempotency by design, so you can ‚Äúapply‚Äù changes repeatedly.
- Clear separation of concerns: creation, seeding, labelling, topics, protection.
- Metadata-first: meta/intent.yml is the single source of truth for P ‚Üí D ‚Üí C ‚Üí S.
