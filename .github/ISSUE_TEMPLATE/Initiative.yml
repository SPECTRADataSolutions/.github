        ## SPECTRA Standards
        - British English spelling
        - SPECTRA in ALL CAPS
        - Repo names: camelCase, singular nouns
        - camelCase only for Fabric pipelines, repo names, and code
        - No secrets in code
        **Dream:** SPECTRA
        ‚òÅÔ∏è core ‚Äî All cross-pillar, meta, or org-wide work is governed by core. Never categorise or label it as a pillar or archetype.
