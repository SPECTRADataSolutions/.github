## naming
- follow **camelCase** for all IDs, fields, and custom names
- issue titles: keep short, clear, and start with the correct emoji/type prefix
- no acronyms unless required by external standards
- do not abbreviate words like "organisation" to "org"; always spell them in full

## linking
- link stories and tasks back to their parent epic or initiative
- link epics back to their parent initiative
