# üèõÔ∏è Canonical Organisational Structure

## Overview

This document defines SPECTRA's authoritative organisational structure based on **Pillars ‚Üí Domains ‚Üí Capabilities ‚Üí Repositories**. This canonical structure ensures consistent classification, governance, and automated enforcement across all repositories.

## üìã Hierarchy Definition

### Spectrafied 7√ó7√ó7 Organisational Grid

The SPECTRA organisational structure follows a canonical 7√ó7√ó7 cube design: 7 pillars √ó 7 domains √ó 7 capabilities = 343 atomic elements. Each element is mononym (single word), orthogonal (no overlaps), canonical (universally recognised), pertinent (directly relevant), and elemental (irreducible at this layer).

### Pillars

Seven high-level capability categorisations representing fundamental organisational functions:

1. **Protection** - Security, compliance, privacy, resilience, risk management, safety, assurance
2. **Guidance** - Vision, leadership, navigation, ethics, governance, alignment, decision-making
3. **Growth** - Learning, scaling, adaptation, performance, talent development, opportunity, progression
4. **Engagement** - Community, communication, partnerships, participation, culture, reputation, inclusion
5. **Innovation** - Creativity, research, technology, transformation, design, experimentation, invention
6. **Sustenance** - Resources, energy, provision, maintenance, logistics, support, capacity
7. **Execution** - Process, delivery, operations, precision, efficiency, method, output

#### Pillar Ordering

Pillars are ordered for optimal cognitive load distribution:
**Protection, Guidance, Growth, Engagement, Innovation, Sustenance, Execution**

### Domains

Each pillar contains exactly 7 single-word camelCase domains (49 total):

#### Protection Domains

- `security` - Access control, identity management, defence, monitoring, encryption, firewall, response

### Capabilities

Each domain contains exactly 7 single-word camelCase capabilities (343 total). Capabilities represent atomic, irreducible functional units within their domain context.

### Repositories

Individual GitHub repositories classified within the 7√ó7√ó7 structure following standard naming conventions.

## üîß Implementation Requirements

### Repository Metadata

Every repository must declare its organisational position in machine-readable format using the Spectrafied 7√ó7√ó7 structure:

```yaml
# .spectra/metadata.yml
pillar: [Protection|Guidance|Growth|Engagement|Innovation|Sustenance|Execution]
domain: [one of 7 domains per pillar]
capabilities: [one of 7 capabilities per domain]
repository: [repository-name]
```

**Example:**

```yaml
# .spectra/metadata.yml
pillar: Guidance
domain: governance
capabilities: framework
repository: .github
```

### README Declaration

Every repository README must include the organisational hierarchy:

```markdown
## üèõÔ∏è Organisational Structure
**Pillar:** Guidance
**Domain:** governance
**Capabilities:** framework
**Repository:** .github

This repository is part of SPECTRA's Spectrafied 7√ó7√ó7 organisational structure. For more information, see [Canonical Organisational Structure](https://github.com/SPECTRADataSolutions/.github/blob/main/docs/canonicalOrganisationalStructure.md).
```

```

### Issue Template Integration
All issue templates must capture and validate organisational metadata through structured forms.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Automation & Enforcement

### Validation Workflow
Repositories now use the inline workflow `validate-organisation-structure` (centralised logic; reusable variant deprecated). Example minimal workflow already provided in this repository at `.github/workflows/validate-organisation-structure.yml`:

```yaml
name: validate-organisation-structure
on:
  pull_request:
    paths: [".spectra/metadata.yml", "README.md"]
  push:
    paths: [".spectra/metadata.yml", "README.md"]

jobs:
  validate-structure:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            // See repository workflow for full logic ‚Äì validates README nav block & metadata coherence
            console.log('Refer to validate-organisation-structure workflow implementation.')
```

### CI Enforcement Rules

- **Schema Validation**: All metadata must conform to `contracts/orgStructureMetadata.json`
- **Naming Conventions**: Domains must be single-word camelCase
- **Pertinence Check**: Domains must be valid for their pillar
- **Completeness**: All levels must be declared

## üìö Governance Rules

### Framework Authority

- **frameworkIsLaw**: No local variations permitted
- **britishEnglish**: All documentation uses British spelling
- **camelCase**: Consistent naming conventions throughout
- **canonicalSetsChangeByGovernanceOnly**: Archetype and domain enumerations require governance approval

### Change Management

1. **Pillar Changes**: Require leadership approval and organisation-wide impact assessment
2. **Domain Changes**: Must demonstrate pertinence to pillar and avoid naming conflicts
3. **Repository Migration**: Follow structured playbooks and validation checklists

## üéØ Success Indicators

- ‚úÖ 100% repositories declare pillar/domain in machine-readable metadata and README
- ‚úÖ 0 non-pertinent domain assignments post-migration (CI + spot checks)
- ‚úÖ CI blocks merge on invalid pillar/domain/single-word rule violations
- ‚úÖ Quarterly stewardship review cadence established

## üõ†Ô∏è Migration Guide

### For Existing Repositories

1. **Assess Current State**: Identify existing metadata patterns
2. **Classify Repository**: Determine appropriate pillar and domain
3. **Add Metadata**: Create `.spectra/metadata.yml` with organisational structure
4. **Update README**: Add organisational structure section
5. **Configure CI**: Add / adapt `validate-organisation-structure` workflow
6. **Validate**: Run validation and fix any issues

### Repository Metadata Pattern

```yaml
# .spectra/metadata.yml
pillar: [Guidance|Innovation|Engagement|Execution|Protection|Sustenance|Growth]
domain: [pertinent single-word camelCase domain]
capabilities: [single-word camelCase capabilities]
repository: [repository-name]
```

### README Snippet Template

```markdown
## üèõÔ∏è Organisational Structure
**Pillar:** [Your Pillar]
**Domain:** [yourDomain]
**Capabilities:** [yourCapabilities]
**Repository:** [repository-name]

This repository is part of SPECTRA's canonical organisational structure. For more information, see [Canonical Organisational Structure](https://github.com/SPECTRADataSolutions/.github/docs/canonicalOrganisationalStructure.md).
```

## üìû Support & Governance

- **Schema Questions**: Reference `contracts/orgStructureMetadata.json`
- **Classification Help**: Create issue with `@copilot` assignment
- **Change Requests**: Follow governance approval process
- **Validation Issues**: Check CI logs and validator workflow
